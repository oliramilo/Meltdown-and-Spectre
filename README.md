# Meltdown and Spectre attack exploit

## Introduction

This report comprehensively examines Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. Our goal is to dissect these vulnerabilities, offering a technical analysis of their underlying mechanisms. We will explore the "how" to understand the core principles and mechanisms facilitating these attacks. We will also investigate the "how to" by methodically deconstructing the techniques used for execution. Lastly, we will thoroughly examine "how to mitigate" these threats, explaining the strategies and defences in place to protect systems and valuable data.


## Requirements
> * Requires a machine that is susceptible to Meltdown & Spectre Attacks, prior to OS patch


### Attack based on the SEED Labs
